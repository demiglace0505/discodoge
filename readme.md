This is a project built from Brad Traversy's course [Next.js Dev to Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/). In this project, we used Next.js and Strapi for the backend, from which we can manage users, events and media. This project gives users the ability to create their accounts and manage events. We use Cloudinary for hosting and optimizing our images. The project also features authentication using json web tokens, page pagination, search functionality, and maps using mapbox. For dev, the database will be using the default SQLite that Strapi uses. For prod, we will be deploying Strapi to Heroku and use postgres. The Next.js app will be deployed in Vercel.

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as SSR and SSG. This allows the first page load to be rendered by the server which is great for SEO and performance. It also gives us data fetching methods, api routes, out of the box TypeScript and Sass. Next.js also have backend capabilities that can handle request response, creating api routes. In order to host a full Next.js application, the server needs to have node.js installed.
